**A physical unclonale function** is a physical object which operation cannot be reproduced ("cloned") **in physical way** (by making another system using the same technology), that for a given input and condition(challenge), provides a physicall defined "digital fingerprint" output (response), that serves as a `unique identifier`, most often for a semiconductor device such a microprocessor[1]
